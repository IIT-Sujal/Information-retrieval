Deleted a lot of stuff
How do you convert this to a bit map

You're supposed to delete everything above the "cut here" mark and
below the lower cut here mark and uudecode it  but
I was not able to unexpected end of file encountered at the last line

could you please repost it or tell be what I'm doing wrong

Sounds like the original poster of the bitmap uuencoded the file
on a DOS machine and you tried to uudecode it on a Unx machine and your
uudecode program balked at the carraigereturns
Well my newsreader shows the UUE file as having lots of spaces which
means it's broken before I even try to download it Did anyone get it
to uudecode successfully

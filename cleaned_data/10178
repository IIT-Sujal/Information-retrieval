	I'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare
	Windows itself almost never crashes but it can be crashed by
	an errant application My personal favorite  Any one of the Corel

	a number of times mostly just running it's own applications

I  do know  that  IBM systems the PS2 56SLC2 in  particular have
absolutely no  problem  with  OS2never had  a "random" crash  while
running any of  my programs under  OS2   In fact I  don't  remember
ever crashing

Of course I really don't run any  OS2 programs just the  same bunch
of DOS and Windows stuff that I've always been running

And  when  I  had  the  56SLC  this is  the  386SLC  system  running
DosWindows I had only  one crash and it was consistent   FTP had a
tendency  to  crash  whenever  I would  get  large  files 1mb  from
particularly fast  clients  DTR's  150K200Ksec I  figured out the
problem was with smartdrv's write bufferingif I turned off the write
buffer everything would work fine

FTP under OS2 has never locked  though  I can even format  floppies
to use the most often cited example of the superiority of OS2

	For instance I'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed
	WP 51 DOS locks up my system

Yeah I guess I'm willing to admit that OS2  is somewhat sensitive to
specific hardware  WP51 for DOS works perfectly fine on my SLC2

	Please explain  The only time I wait on anything under Windows is
	when I'm copying or formatting a floppy or when printing and even
	then not longI get 9 to 11 pages dumped to the printman per 
	minute and can still go do thingsslowlywhile it's doing 
	thisI've downloaded with PP+ @9600 while printing

Well  I save all  my  personal files to floppy  and when  i did that
under Windows a floppy save of a large file hung up the system

I  also found  it quite bothersome to  have  to  continually tweak the
tasking options  on fractint for dos whenever I wanted to do a fractal
computation in the background

 and not being able to address your memory better than DOS

	Not sure what you mean here

The idea is  that OS2's DOS sessions can see more memory than Windows
DOS  sessions  I  let  XPL a  shareware calculus program see around
720KB of free conventional memory which lets me  do bigger symbolic
manipulations than is possible  under straight DOS where it would see
around 610KB of conventional RAM  I  also found it really handy for
my own DOSbased programs which without  any rewriting could now
handle larger data sets simulate for more iterations etc Of course
the  point is  now moot  since  the OS2 programs I now write  simply
never run into memory limitations  I never programmed  for Windows
so I don't have much of a comparison here though

I think you're deliberatly overstating the requirements for OS2  
Considering that OS2 is a multithreaded true multitasking OS and
takes the place of DOS and Windows and more I actually think the 
requirements for OS2 are very reasoable  I also think that anyone
using Windows 31 without 8 megs of RAM a 38640 and 200 megs of
hard drive space is beating their head against a wall  Those are
also legitimate requirements for OS2  In fact the requirements 
for Windows 31 and OS2 are about equal

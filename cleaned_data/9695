   Dear friend
     The RISC means "reduced instruction set computer" The RISC usually has 
   small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase 
   the clock rate to have a high performance You can read some books about
   computer architecture for more information about RISC

RISC used to mean "Reduced Instruction Set Computer" true  They
still use the same acronym but only to be familiar  What RISC really
means is a recentlydesigned CPU  

In general most RISC CPUs are like this

    A large number 32 or more of generalpurpose registers
    A fixed instruction size usually 32 bits
    An instruction may make only one memory reference
    Memory references must be aligned
    There are delayed branches branch after the next instruction or
a target prediction bit probably willwon't branch
    Instructions may complete out of order relative to the instruction
stream

OS2 20 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along

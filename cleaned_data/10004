Does anyone know a program that will record keyboard sequences that I

seem to be able to record the key sequences

Thanks STeve

I think you would need a DOS macro program  Superkey by Borland
comes to mind  I don't think Windows is capable of sending
keystrokes to a DOS window

What you want to do sounds like a security problem to me though

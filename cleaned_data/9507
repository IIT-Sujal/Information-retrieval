Hello
  
  I'm investigating the purchase of an Object Oriented Application Framework  I have
come across a few that look good
Zinc

  Has a platform independent resource strategy  Not too important for me right now

Just a thought on resources  It is very important if you do use a
multiplatform toolkit to check on how it uses resources  I have
used Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2  I wrote a resource
converter from OS2 to Motif but it really wasn't too easy especially
the naming scheme In Motif you cannot rename controlswidgets
With windows you can call the OK button IDOK in every instance
this doesn't work for Motif you'd have to call it Dialog1OK
and Motif expects a text string rather than a number  So 
your constructor should know how to convert a define into the
proper resource identifier
I'd check on how the toolkit expects names and that if it does
use resources that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to
port to  By the way I would never use CommonView or Glockenspiel
for anything

Subject Re Drivers for Stealth 24

Doug Ward writes

I recently purchased a Diamond Stealth 24 Video card and received
the wrong drivers  Does anyone know where I can ftp the proper
drivers  The dstlth file at cica does not work with
this video card  Please respond to doug@sunswsuiucedu

Thank you
Doug Ward

If you want to get them and get them now also the most up to date use
the BBS at 14084399096  They may take an hour to download so do it
when rates are low  Yeah I know it costs but locking up your system
gets old quick  Maybe someone has them on the net  I've got the
Stealth drivers

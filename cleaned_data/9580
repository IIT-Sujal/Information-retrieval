	First of all without wanting to sound nagging and bossy yes it is
a trivial answer and that's perfectly fine  otherwise how is one supposed
to move up to the complicated and challenging questions we net readers so
much enjoy   and the massive crossposting of your article was not
 justified
Please refer to appropriate newsgroups next time by the way comswmisc is
OK   Now as far as your problem is concerned try playing around with
the settings in the 'Fonts" dialog box under the window control menu that
little square at the top left corner of the window

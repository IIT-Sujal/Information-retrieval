Anyway how about this I give you my word without naming sources that IBM
paid companies to write applications for OS2  Satisfied

Not really Query What do you mean by PAID  Are you implying that helped to
offset development costs or paid for the entire cost of producing the product

I mean they paid the companies that developed the applications ie "We'll
give you x million dollars if you port application y to OS2"  I suppose
the company in question could use the x million dollars for whatever they
want

Would you like to post figures
for MS as well I suppose

Ted

No I'd rather not  First of all I don't have exact figures and I don't
want to disclose how I know this  However I will say that Jim Francis
from Microsoft just posted a figure of $26 million payment from IBM to
Borland and that's somewhere in the range that I've heard

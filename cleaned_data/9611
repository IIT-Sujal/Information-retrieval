Subject Re Borland's Paradox Offer

I am considering buying Borland's Paradox for Windows since I
would like to use a database with Windows I don't haveuse
one yet for both workhome use  I would like to advantage
of Borland's "$12995 until April 30" offer if this package
is everything that Borland claims it to be  So I was
wondering  has anybody used this andor have any opinions

I've been using MS Access still available from some stores for $9900
and I am quite pleased with it  It's relatively easy to learn very easy
to use and somewhat easy to program  I highly recomend it particularly
at $9900  I have not used Paradox for Windows but I don't expect it to
be $3000 better than Access IMHO

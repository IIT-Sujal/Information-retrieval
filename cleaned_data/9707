Subject Character missing in TTF

Word 20c doesn't show the periodcentred character to indicate
spaces if I use the TTFonts from CorelDraw  Our editors need to
be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character 
displayed is a large hollow box  They overlap each other and
characters on each side which is useless

I believe the character used by W4W is the periodcentred 0183
This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the
hollow box which tends to confirm this  I have edited the corel
font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183
character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W
Altering the paragraph 0182 or cedilla 0184 does alter their font
graphics displayed however

Is the W4W character used to indicate spaces the periodcentred
character  Has anyone been able to get this character displayed
from a CorelDraw TTF

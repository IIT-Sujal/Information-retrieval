     This may be an FAQ if so please direct me to the known answer but I
     am getting frustrated and looking for help
 
     I am running Win 31 with NDW 22 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a
     6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my
     applications are not giving back system resources when I close them

I've noticed this also  The way it was explained to me is that Windows
does not clear the upper memory blocks after a program is done  Anyone
out there know if this is why

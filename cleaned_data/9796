When I use telix or kermit in WIN 31 or use telix after exiting windows
to dos telix can not find the serial port If you have some ideas on how
to solve this problem or where I can find further information send me email
or send it to the news group  Thanks

You may have to define your serial ports under windows I think it's the 
Control Panel PORTS options

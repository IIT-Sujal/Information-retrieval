Subject Re Workspace Manager for Win 31

Are there any Workspace Managers out there for Windows 31 

Try WorkShift by Karl Thoreddson The latest version is 20 or later but
the following is at Cica in the Desktop directory
WRKSFT16 ZIP  WorkShift Graphical Virtual Desktop ver 16

Or email Karl and ask him to put version 20 up
Karl's email karlth@rhihiis from the MSWrite file of v16

I was Beta tester for WorkShift and must say it is very good
I gain nothing from saying that
It'll even remember your WorkShifts WorkSpaces as you said between
Windows sessions

Thanks in advance
Your Welcome

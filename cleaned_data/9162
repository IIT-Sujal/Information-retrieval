I've just bought a PC which came with a bundle of Lotus stuff including
Adobe Type Manager version 115 As a newcomer to Windows I'm
confused about which I should be using ATM or Truetype 

 

There is a program called trueeffects for windows that allows you to define
attributes for truetype fonts and have them look like new fonts  It will
give your font different backgrounds or shadows or reverse etc

It ONLY works with TT fonts

Yes and the idea was ripped off from Adobe which has had a program
called  TypeAlign for a few years now  TypeAlign does the same thing
for Adobe Type 1 fonts; and Adobe has said that the next version
will work with both Adobe Type 1 and TrueType

And TypeAlign does some things that TrueEffects does not  including
some things you apparently want 

If you want to use it you best not want to use it with an ATM type font

Oh yeah lest you think this is a really cool program none of the 
effects are scalable  like the brick background pattern is the same size
whether your font is 10 point of 100 point and it is not extensible
IE you CAN NOT add pattern of your own
And you can't rorate the background pattern
And you can't make the pattern extend beyond one character
	Every character in that new font has the entire pattern in it
	As opposed to having the SAME pattern run contiguously through
	a couple of characters

It is however cheap
Maybe I will buy a copy when the next version comes out if they fix some of
these gripes

Subject Setting up threeuser accounting system with WFWG

I am a novice at best in working with pc networks and am in the
process of planning a small accounting system for a small business

The particular need in this case is for three machines each in a
different office of the same building each having access to a
Windowsbased accounting system

My first thought is to set up MS Windows for Workgroups on each of the
machines likely a 486 and two 386's along with the appropriate Ethernet
cards and cabling that come with the Windows for Workgroups starter kit one
additional user kit will be necessary  It then seems logical to purchase
a simple multiuser accounting system along the lines of DacEasy or
MYOB and fire it all up  The 486 will more or less act as server with
a reportcheck printer attached to it
Cable runs of 3040 feet will be necessary for this setup

Well this all seems too easy to me  Would any of you network gurus out
there tell me if I am out of my mind here  Any and all suggestions however
trivial will be immensely appreciated  My apologies if this has been
brought up before

Thanks

John

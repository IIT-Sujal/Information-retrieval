Subject Hard drive compression ie stackersuperstor etc


I was wondering if any one knew how the various hard drive compression utilities work  My hard
drive is getting full and I don't want to have to buy a new one  What I'm intrested in is speed
ease of use amount of compression and any other aspect you think might be important as I've never
use one of these things before thanks  Morgan Bullard mb4008@coewlcenuiucedu

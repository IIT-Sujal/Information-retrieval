What the status of Trumpet for Windows Will it use the Windows sockets 
I liked it in DOS but had to abandon it since I started using NDIS to access
our token ring results in invalid class error 

While I do not speak for Peter Tattam I am fairly sure he is planning a 
Winsock compliant version  While this will definitely not make the initial
public release of WinTrumpet it will follow on shortly thereafter

Currently WinTrumpet is in very late beta  It looks like an excellent 
product with several features beyond the DOS version

WinTrumpet supports the Trumpet TCP Novell LWP and there is also a direct to 
packet driver version that some people are using with the dispkt shim

Development of what  Inhouse apps  Maybe but  certainly not apps
to be sold on an open market  Statistics like that are laughable
because they may simply mean that there are not enough shrinkwrapped
usable apps for UNIX and they have to be developed disproportionately
often as compared to the installed UNIX base

Actually you might be surprised to find that not everyone who develops
mainstream DOS and Windows apps develops them under DOS or Windows  PC
Week recently printed a rumor that Microsoft's Excel development group
does its development under OS2  Another trade rag did an article
recently about a group doing Windows development on Sun SPARCstations
with SoftPC to test out their work  SCO Unix is and has been a
reasonably popular development platform for DOS Windows and even OS2
apps  DOS and Windows are simply not robust or stable enough for
development work IMHO and apparently others agree

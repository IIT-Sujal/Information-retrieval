Subject Re Borland's Paradox Offer


I am considering buying Borland's Paradox for Windows since I
would like to use a database with Windows I don't haveuse
one yet for both workhome use  I would like to advantage
of Borland's "$12995 until April 30" offer if this package
is everything that Borland claims it to be  So I was
wondering  has anybody used this andor have any opinions

If you are interested in a program which is very easy to use I strongly 
suggest Approach 20  It is extremely easy to use make reports etc  I
own both it and Paradox and I almost never use Paradox  If you need to 
build up a complicated application then Paradox is the way to go  I have
heard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic
Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff work
home use and you have not used a database before I recommend Approach  I 
have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily
I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must 
be different than what is the logical ordering  To permanently reorder to 
use the old DBASE III command the records requires sorting the records 
appropriately no problem since I almost always use them in this order
exporting the database to another database which can still be an Approach 
database and then copying the exported files back to the original 
filename  This is a small weakness considering the other items I really 
like about Approach  It is also a little slower than Paradox other than 
the loading Paradox takes forever and a minute to load  Paradox also 
takes a lot of memory both hard disk around 12MB and RAM

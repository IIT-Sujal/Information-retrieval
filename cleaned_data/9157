	Again not true The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the 
	maker If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the
	characters in the font of orgin TT allows for much more flexibility
	in this area as well You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font
	file MacPSWindowsUnicode char set and use the characters
	appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on

Well yes both Type 1 and TrueType fonts can contain lots of characters
And in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to Windows ANSI
in Windows and to Mac standard roman encoding on the Mac 
No difference there between T1 and TT   

And as for fonts with thousands of glyphs right know these are a liabiliaty
rather than a great new thing  Reason is that a font with 3000 characters
is very large and if you can only access 224 of them you are paying a heavy
price in downloading time and printer storage  And at the moment there
is only one program of that uses `partial font downloading'

	For instance all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the MacWindows
	char set in them The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font
	is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac
	char set 	

Yes and T1 text fonts all have the `ISO Adobe' character set which is
a superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding

The question is whether you can get at the glyphs  In Windows for example
you cannot get at the ligatures `fi' anfd `fl' both T1 and TTeven though a
font may very well have them

ANd while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type 1 font and to create a
new Windows metric file PFM for it there are utilities out there to allow
you do this  How do I reencode a TrueType font  How can I get at the
`fi' and `fl' ligatures in Windows or on the Mac  Are there utilities
that make it possible to circumvent the hardwired Windows ANSI encoding

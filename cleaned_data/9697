Can someone out there tell me how to switch Window's screen resolution
quickly and easily  I know that I can go back into install to do it

 	Take a look at ftpcicaindianaedu at pubpcwin3utilmisc
for a program caleld vswitchzipIt's as close to want you want as you can
get in WIn31 

I think George is referring to switchzip in the ~ftppubpcwin3driversvideo
directory Description reads  Switcher Windows Video Mode Switcher

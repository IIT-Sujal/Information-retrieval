From lisbon@vpnetchiilus Gerry Swetsky
Subject Program manager  two questions


1 Is it possible to change the icons in the program groups  I'd like
    to give them some individuality

2 Can you set up a shortcut key to return to the Program Manager 
    I know CTLESC ESC will do it but I'd rather set it up so I 
    can avoid the task list and get back to the PM with ALTF1

Any and all help is welcomed

Subject Teacher for Windows NT

We are searching for one or two instructors for tutorials on advanced
Windows programming under NT  If anyone has attended a course that was
very good we would really appreciate recommendations

Please email me directly at paller@fedunixorg; I don't get to see these
newsgroups often enough

Thanks in advance for any help

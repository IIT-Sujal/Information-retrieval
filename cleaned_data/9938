Subject Looking for Tom Haapanen

I'm trying to find Tom Haapanen formerly tom@wesonca
who was the keeper of the FAQ for this newsgroup
He was working at Watrerloo Engineering Software
but netfind can't even find that but it may have
been a uucp connection  If anyone knows how to
contact Tom please let me know

Thanks

Hey now  First of all sorry to post this DOS question in a WINDOWS
group but I'm in kinda a hurry so I can't scramble to find the dos
groups' names  

Anyway anyone know where I ccan find the exit codes to DOS commands

There are 3 alternatives
1 You can try to write a small C program something like

   int myintvar;
   myintvar = system"command";

   and display myintvar value which is the exit code of the command

2 Or use 4doscom instead of commandcom it has built in move command
   you can also get any program exist code by using the exec function
   of 4dos

   cecho @exec[command]

   will display the exit code of the command

3 Get DOS 6 not worth buying if you already have QEMMPCToolsNorton
   and you only need the move utility

the manual doesn't seem to have all of them  I'm particularly looking
for COPY in order to make a "move" batch file such that if the file
wasn't coppied properly it won't be deleted


please e'mail louray@seasgwuedu
Thanks IA

 Has anyone used a Hercules Graphite adapter  It looks good on paper and
 Steve Gibson gave it a very good review in Infoworld  I'd love to get a
 realworld impression though  how is the speed  Drivers  Support
 
 The PC World reviewers found out that the Herc people had hardcoded
                                            

I think it was the IIT people who make the chip the card is based on who hardcoded
the string

One of the weeklies looked into this an came to the conclusion that the IIT chip
was still pretty fast

 Winbench text into the driver Clever no In any case the Winbench
 results are pretty much inflated
 
 When and if you get one send me mail I might buy that ATI GU off

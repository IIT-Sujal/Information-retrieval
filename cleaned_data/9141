 Hi
 I wonder if anyone has had a chance try out Norton Desktop for Windows
 version 22 yet I understand the upgrade cost from 20 to 22 is about
 $2000 but I have no idea what the new version has
  
I got the offer to upgrade this weekend It's $19 + $850 shipping and
handling The S+H seem way too steep for just a couple of disks Sounds
like ripoff city Can this purchased at vendors

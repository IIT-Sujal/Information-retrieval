    This may be an FAQ if so please direct me to the known answer but I
    am getting frustrated and looking for help

    I am running Win 31 with NDW 22 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a
    6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my
    applications are not giving back system resources when I close them

While working on my shareware toolbar I found myself 'eating' resources
and a very wise person pointed me to the SDK and specifically the debug
kernel Once you have all the SDK stuff installed this also comes with
VC++ you run 'n2d' which does a 'normaltodebug' swap The debug kernel
runs C O N S I D E R A B L Y slower but you then execute the command
DBWIN and let it report to you what is going on You are going to find
out a lot more about your Apps than you cared to and possibly about other
peoples Apps is that OPAI'm sorry 

If this doesn't make sense repost or email me

Hello
  
  I'm investigating the purchase of an Object Oriented Application Framework  I have
come across a few that look good

  Zapp 11 from Inmark
  Zinc 35 from Zinc software
  C++Views from Liant
  Win++ from Blaise

Some considerations I'm using

  Being new to Windows programming I'm from the UNIXX world the quality and
intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very 
important  However since I'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windows
programming the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with
the native one  I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction just for the
sake of changing the API are valuable

The Microsoft Founation classes afx that come with CC++ 70 and 
Visual C++ are very good they already have a version for NT
it comes with source code and is very close to the navtive API
It also as some classes to manage data structures

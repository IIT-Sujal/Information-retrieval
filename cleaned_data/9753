Subject speeding up windows

I have a 38633 with 8 megs of memory

I have noticed that lately when I use programs like WpfW or Corel Draw
my computer "boggs" down and becomes really sluggish

What can I do to increase performance  What should I turn on or off

Will not loading wallpapers or stuff like that help when it comes to
the running speed of windows and the programs that run under it

Thanx in advance

Derek

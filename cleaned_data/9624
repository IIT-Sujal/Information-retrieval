  Hi everybody
      I guess my subject has said it all  It is getting boring
  looking at those same old bmp files that came with Windows  So
  I am wondering if there is any body has some beautiful bmp file
  I can share  Or maybe somebody can tell me some ftp site for
  some bmp files like some scenery files some animals files
  etc  I used to have some unfortunately i delete them all
 
 
I downloaded the CompuServe GIF of the month  A raytraced image of
a golf ball next to a hole  Very nice 640x480x256 bitmap easily
converted to a Windows BMP  If anyone wants I could upload a copy
on Cica

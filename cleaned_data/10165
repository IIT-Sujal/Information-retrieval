Subject Re romanbmp 0114In response to the requests for cool bitmaps I am posting one

Hello Cliff 

Many people on the internet like us have to pay for
every byte of data passed through subscribed news groups

Bitmaps are large Bitmaps cost us a lot of money There are
special newsgroups for bitmaps because of this We don't
subscribe to them Put you bitmaps in the right place
Read one of the FAQ guides in the newuser groups and it
will tell you all about bitmaps and the thousands of
establishments like mine that you have just cost money

Some of them have very limited budgets

Go away

PS This is a flame ;
PPS You distribution of "usa" didn't work

 2  Is the driver support as seamless as program support
 eg Will my Soundblaster scanner CDRom tape backup
 continue to work even if there are no specific NT drivers
 
 There is a hardware compatibility guide to answer these questions
 There are many drivers for CD Rom and there are MIDI and other
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 sound drivers installed I dont do a lot with sound digitizing on this
 platform but recall seeing items for their configuration in the Control
 Panel Applet  There is built in support for tape backup systems as well

[]

My Problem I wasn't aware of the fact that I would need an SCSICDROM for
Windows NT when ordering the BetaSDKPackage So my question Is there any driver
available that will allow me to use my Mitsumi NonSCSI CDROM for installation 
If there is one from which place ftpsite can I get it 

Many thanks in advance

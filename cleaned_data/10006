I am looking for the latest drivers for the Actix graphics accelerator card
The driver I am currently using is version 121 and doesn't support more
than 256 colors in 1024x768 mode even you have 2MB memory
The BBS support for Actix is unbelievable They are still using 2400bps
modem It will take you hours to download the drivers it hurts when you
are calling long distance Is there any ftp site that has a collection
of video drivers for windows
BTW anyone using this card and how do you like it so far

good but where are these drivers

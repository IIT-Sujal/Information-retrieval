NOW another thing
this is from the windows' FAQ
 
your file has to be less than 64 K
 at least that's what the faq says but Mine wont work for more than

COM files are limited to a total size of 64KB  Thus wincfn plus vgalogolog 
plus your RLE file must be less than 64KB  Thus your RLE file should be 
around 30KB

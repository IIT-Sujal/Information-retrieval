Subject        Help Needed w DOS Apps and Windows

Since loading Windows two of my DOS applications have been
acting strangely  It appears that font changes and page
orientation changes so far are not being recognized in
WordPerfectDOS and QuattroProDOS  Another DOS application
does accept font and page orientation changes so I don't
think the problem is with the printer

I reloaded QuattroPro and these changes are still not
accepted whether launching from Windows or the DOS prompt

Does anyone have any suggestions as to where to look or how to
correct this problem  I've ordered QuattroPro for Windows
but need a landscape application printed immediately  Please email

Thanks in advance

 I have an EISA machine and I just do not understand why most
 EISA video cards only match the performance of their ISA
 counterparts For instance the EISA Orchid Pro Designer IIsE is
 only about as "fast" as the ISA Diamond SpeedStar Plus which isn't
 what I would call "fast"
 
 I don't understand why EISA video cards aren't as a group on the
 same level of performance as Local Bus cards given that EISA video
 cards have a 32 bit bus to move data around instead of ISA's 8 bits
 
Good question
Answer The EISA bus does move 32 bits rather than ISA's 816
        But it still moves it at about the speed as the ISA bus
        I think that's either 8 or 10 mhz
        The local bus designs also move 32 bits like the EISA but
        they move the data at the cpu speed up to 40 mhz
        So on a 33mhz cpu the local bus is moving 32bit data at
        33 mhz and the EISA is moving 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz
        So the local bus should be 3 to 4 times faster than EISA on
        a 33 mhz cpu  EISA should be about two maybe 3 times as
        fast as ISA

I would expect the EISA board to be more than twice as fast as the ISA
board  Not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide at
least but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for
bus transactions between the two busses  Most ISA boards require
multiple clocks per bus transaction  typically this is around 34
EISA boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a 11 rate so I
would expect performance to be 6x8x that of an ISA card  

So I guess for me the question is unanswered still  I would expect
him to be able to see a 6x speed difference and he apparently does
not

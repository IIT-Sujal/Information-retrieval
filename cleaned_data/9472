Subject Diamond SS24X Win 31 Mouse cursor


Anybody seen mouse cursor distortion running the Diamond 1024x768x256 driver
Sorry don't know the version of the driver no indication in the menus but it's a recently
delivered Gateway system  Am going to try the latest drivers from Diamond BBS but wondered
if anyone else had seen this

post or email
